We will be learning version control, how to clone repositories, how to frok make pull requests and merge repositories and a whole
bunch of really exciting things.

Question :- What is version control ?
Answer :- Let's say that I create a new code file and I write a few lines in it, Now I decide to put it under version contriol Git,
          and let;s say that I call this save points as number 1. Now this is my first version. Later on as I progress I write maybe a 
          few more code of line of code and at this point I decide to make another save point and I call this my second version.
          So further down the line I accidentally screw up my entire code file and it's irreparable and I get to the point where i would
          rather burn my entire code file rather than having to try and fix it.

          You do get into these situations because very ften your code is interlinked and each class depends on another and sometimes
          you can screw up in a way where you know all hope is lost and I simply just want to rollback to the last save point. I can do that using Git.

Here we will simplify some terms to understand what's going on

Question : What happen when we type the command git init ?
Answer:- After doing that, .git file get created which is a hidden file. You can see that file by writing this
         command ls -a

         .git file is going to be used to track all the chnages, to commit your changes and to perform version control.

Question : What is working directory ?
Answer : In the directory particularly in which you are working is called working directory which is GitWorking/localImplementation.


Question :- What is staging area ?
Staging Area :- Here, In order to start tracking the changes of my files for example chapter1.txt then I need to add this file to what's called a 
                staging Area.

                It is basically a intermediate place where you can pick and choose which files inside your working directory that
                you want to commit. So to see what's currently inside your staging area, you can use the git status command and It shows
                you that there are untracked files which will be shown in red and this is something that simply inside          

                command which you have to write :- git status (check 1.jpg)

                In order to add it to the stging area and to start tracking changes in it, then we have to use the command 
                $ git add chapter1.txt 

                or 
                To add multiple file use this
                $ git add .

                if you want to check what changes we have made you can also see that
                $ git log

                (It will give you the time and date and It also has a hash(A long number containg alphabets and numbers) uniquely identifies this particular commit and then 
                right at the end you see this commit message of what this save point was all about.)
                
                Question: What does it mean (head -> master) ?
                Answer : head shows the current position state that we are in.

Question :- What is $ git diff ?
Answer :- git diff tells what change has occured with respect to previous file.

Working
-> We will how work is getting done

Step1 :- We create a file in our "working directory" inside our "GitWorking directory".
Step2 :- So the working directory is the folder or the directory where you initialize your Git repository.
         When we did git init that we done it in "GitWorking directory/localImplementation" so that becomes our working directory.
Step3 :- From now on Git is going to try and track the changes that it sees between the working directory and
         local repository.
Step4 :- We used git add . to add files to the staging area. This extra step is there sometimes we might not want to add all of our files to be tracked or all of our files
         to be committed. It is the area where you can decide what to ignore waht to not.
Step5 :- Next step is to commit using the git command $ git commit -m "Your_Message". Now our file is inside our local 
         repository.
Step6 :- We can $ git checkout to revert back or rollback to the last position in our local repository.
