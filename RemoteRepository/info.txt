Here, We will learn about Remote repository.
Basically we are going to use github, Searching this on google what we have to do

Step1 :- First create a account if already created then go to navbar checkoit the "+" option then go to
         new repository.
         There you can create new repository then you can give the name then when you click the create button, The repository
         will get created. 

         They will give you the steps to do further setting or to send your local repository to remote repository.

Step2 :- The commands which we are going to use is
         $ git remote add origin https://github.com/ManavAnand6/GitWorkingg.git

         Question :- What this command mean ?
         Answer :- "origin" is the name of your remote and you can theoritically call it anything you want.
                   (Recommended keep the name origin)

                   then add the URL of our remote repository.

Step3 :- Now we can push our repository to remote one whose name is origin
         Git command :- $ git push -u origin master
         
         Meaning :- It will push the local repository to remote repository using -u flag which basically links up
                    your local repository and remote repository and then we going pust it t remote name origin, we going 
                    to push to the branch named "master".

                    "master" branch basically a default branch or the main branch.
